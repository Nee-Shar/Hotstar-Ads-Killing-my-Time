# KILL HOTSTAR ADS ðŸš«ðŸ“º

Tired of Hotstar ads ruining your binge? Just hit **Alt + S** and _poof_ â€” ads skipped or muted. Easy peasy.

**Update**-> Web Version of hotstar doesnt provide option for inc speed so i did.

## Whatâ€™s this?

A tiny browser extension that kicks Hotstar ads to the curb. No fancy stuff, just pure ad-block magic when you need it.

And to speed up when you dont want to listen to all the drama and skip to good part or slow it down just to enjoy that particular moment.

## How to use?

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Load it in your browser as an unpacked extension.
3. Watch Hotstar.
4. Smash **Alt + S** whenever an ad pops up. Boom, gone.
5. Smash **Alt + U** to speed up boring part (0.25x at a time).
6. Smash **Alt + I** to speed down and live in the moment (0.25x at a time).
